# Tarot
Small Python App to read Tarot.

git clone https://github.com/ThornEnterprise/Tarot.git

Just run 'python Tarot.py' | 'python3 Tarot.py' depending on OS and Python Version. 

Tarot.py calls Deck.py as a module to serve cards. 

Contributions are welcome. Plenty of room to add, improve, and optimize.
